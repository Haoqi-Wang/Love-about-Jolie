    const text = `Hi Jolie:\n\nToday is 20 May, a day for couples. But I think it is also a day for you, because you are so worthy of being loved, not just today, but every single day.\n\nI keep thinking about the words we shared that night. To me, love means simply being there—through silence, storms, and sunshine. I would always want you to feel my gaze whenever you look back, knowing I am by your side. When you’re feeling lost or uncertain, I want to be the one you turn to, the one who listens and comforts. And when you’re happy, oh, I want to be there too—celebrating every little joy with you, feeling your happiness as if it were my own. Love isn’t just about sharing the good times, so I want to walk together with you through everything—your fears, your dreams, your laughter, your tears—always side by side.\n\nThough I can’t predict if there’s a place for me in your future, I want you to know that right here, right now, I am always here. Whether it’s in the light of day or the quiet of the night, I will be waiting for the moment you need me. \n\nHappy 520! Hope you can be a happy rabbit!
\n\nLove,\nMark`;
